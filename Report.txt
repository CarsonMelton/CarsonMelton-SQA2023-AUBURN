Report for Final Project

# 1
Executing bandit during the commit action was completed by adding a bandit -r command to the pre-commit file associated
with my repository. This action recursively checks for security weaknesses inside the repository. A screenshot of the pre-commit
file is included with my submission.

# 2
To complete the fuzzing portion of the project, fuzz.py was created to test invalid parameter inputs for various methods
within parser.py, scanner.py, and graphtaint.py. The invalid strings used in the fuzzing of these methods were collected
from the text file given from Workhop 8. The command to execute fuzz.py was also added to the pre-commit file so that
it would be executed during github actions. fuzz.py is located within the Github repository.

# 3 
The logging portion of the project was created by importing the logging libray in main.py and scanner.py to track the
execution of these files. logger.py was written to create logging objects so that the recorded output may be collected 
in output files for review. Screenshots of the included logging calls and the loggin output are included with my submission.

What I learned
From this project I learned a lot and was able to reinforce many of the ideas introduced by the previous workshops. I was able to
apply the knowledge gained into real code and get hands-on experience. Analyzing the codebase to create real testing using 
fuzzing and logging methods allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the code. Throughout this process I was also able
to gain a greater understanding of git and how to use it to the fullest of my ability.
